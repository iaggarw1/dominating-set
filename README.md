# Dominating Set Python Program

This program generates random graphs and finds the dominating set using Python. The program utilizes the `networkx` and `matplotlib` libraries.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, run the following commands:

```bash
pip install networkx matplotlib
```

## Running the Program

Once the libraries are installed, you can run the program with:

```bash
python dominating_set.py
```

## Description

- The program generates random graphs.
- It calculates the dominating set of the generated graph.
- The graph and its dominating set are visualized using `matplotlib`.

## Example

Here is an example of how to run the program:

```bash
py dominating_set.py
```

This will generate a random graph, compute its dominating set, and display the graph with the dominating set highlighted.
